                SLM has more than 27 years’ experience advising landlords and tenants on a wide range of contentious land and property issues. 
                We advise on issues arising from tenancy agreements, commercial/residential, landlord and tenant disputes such as buying or selling a home, property evictions, bank foreclosures, boundary rights, adverse possession, quitclaim deeds, lease renewals, forfeitures, right of light and easements. We also advise on property-related professional negligence claims and claims for breach of lease covenants. 
                Related services encompass property litigation, injunctive relief, and repossession. Whenever property disputes occur, the needs of all parties are always the same: to achieve a speedy resolution at minimum cost and minimum disruption to normal activities. Much of this depends on informed understanding of the legal issues and experience in negotiating satisfactory settlements.

                SLM’s legal team typically settles the vast majority of property disputes through negotiation or at mediation. Very rarely does a typical property dispute proceed to trial. But as in all cases, our core aim is to secure our clients’ commercial objectives in the most efficient way possible. Successful outcomes for our clients depend not only on our legal expertise but also on our team’s comprehensive understanding of the property landscape in Uganda and our clients’ business interests. 
                This enables us to be pro-active and flexible. We understand that you need a service that is professional, proactive and focused on helping you to achieve your goals and we are always ready to provide you just that.
