                SLM Advocates handle a wide variety of succession, inheritance and estate management matters that range from convening and managing family meetings, leading family negotiations and managing estate administration. 
                We are experienced in working with small and large estates in both the taste and intestate successions. We understand, too, that in many succession, inheritance and estate administration matters, litigation may not be the best means to achieving clients’ objectives. Where other forms of dispute resolution, such as mediation are more appropriate, we will always choose that course.

                We are sensitive to all the issues involved and seek to protect our clients’ long term interests while efficiently and successfully resolving immediate problems. 
                On matters of succession and estate planning, SLM assists clients in designing and managing trusts, drafting and keeping wills, codicils and related documents and we act as trustees, executors and administrators of estates and trusts. We also represent our clients’ interests in probate-administration and trust-related legal matters.
