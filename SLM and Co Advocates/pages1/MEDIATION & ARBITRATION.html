                There has been a remarkable responsiveness to the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution processes (ADR) throughout the entire dispute resolution landscape the world over. Courts, government agencies and disputants have all embraced mediation, arbitration and conciliation as more efficient and costeffective ways by which to resolve many kinds of disputes at all levels of conflicts—from beginning to end. 
SLM’s well-experienced, accredited and court approved Mediators and Arbitrators strive to facilitate expeditious resolution of clients’ disputes while maintaining and mending their relationships. Although the court system is a good and fair way of dealing with civil disputes, it may not always be the best method by which to resolve particular disputes.
