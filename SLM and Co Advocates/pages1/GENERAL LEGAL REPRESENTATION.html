                At SLM we pride ourselves in being different. We provide empathetic, pragmatic and affordable legal services. We understand that involvement in a lawsuit is stressful and costly. This is why we take a unique approach to litigation. We pursue each matter as if it is our own—leveraging our long experience, expert knowledge, and reputation within the legal community to resolve matters quickly and cost-effectively. We often advise our clients to explore ADR before seeking recourse to litigation. If, however, litigation is the best course of action, we pursue it vigorously and to the fullest extent of the law. Having a well-respected law firm and a knowledgeable team of lawyers on your side in today’s fast growing economic environment is very important. 
                At SLM, we take a personal approach to our clients’ cases and employ pragmatic legal strategies in order to keep our clients’ costs down. We also appropriately delegate some tasks to associates when this provides a cost-saving to you and we always provide transparent billing to our clients.
